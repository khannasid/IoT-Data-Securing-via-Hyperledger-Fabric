# Securing IoT via Hyperledger Fabric
## _This Project aims to design and develop a secure architectural environment that will provide automation with a security layer of Blockchain technology, that introduces high Security and Privacy_

The Overall project is based upon the IoT automation System working under the Private Blockchain Network and can then be virtually accessed. 
We use the open-source IoT platform(s) “Hyperledger Explorer” or “ThingsBoard” for real-time data visualization. And use the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network for providing a private blockchain network.

- Hyperledger Fabric (Private Blockchain)
- MQTT Protocol (IoT network connectivity)
- Hyperledger Explorer
