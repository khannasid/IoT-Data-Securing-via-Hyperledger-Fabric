# This project deals with the emerging problem of Data Securing of IoT Devices. 
# This Project aims to design and develop a secure architectural environment that will provide automation with a security layer of Blockchain technology, that introduces high Security and Privacy.
# The Overall project is based upon the IoT automation System working under the Private Blockchain Network and can then be virtually exccessed. 
# We use the open-source IoT platform(s) “Hyperledger Explorer” or “ThingsBoard” for real-time data visualization. And use the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain network for providing a private blockchain network.
