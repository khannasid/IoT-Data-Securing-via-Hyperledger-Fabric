# file-storing-on-blockchain-network

This project will be broken down into two phases.
1. Creating the Dapp for file storing on IPFS.
2. Creating a Client Side app that will automatically provide the file (image/video).

So, for this project we will use Ethereum Network. And we will store the file in a Distributed File System called IPFS.

Working of the Project-

In this file system, while storing our file we get a Hash Key that works as a pointer to that file. 
We use that Hash code and put it on the Ethereum Smart Contract and Store it onto the network.
As it will provide a reference to the original file that is present on the distributed file system (IPFS).
